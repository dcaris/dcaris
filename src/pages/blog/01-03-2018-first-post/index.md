***Hey***, my name is Daniel Caris and I am a Software Developer from Gold Coast, Australia.

This site will contain my ramblings on items I'm keen to chat about. Trying to improve my Daily Fantasy Sports skills (DFS) so I'll be delving into the realm of sports analytics to try and gain an edge. Enjoy your time here
